<p style="font-size: x-large; "> Ronaldo was born into a low-income family, and thus, he did not receive schooling. 
    Ronaldo is claimed to have thrown a chair at one of his school instructors when he was 14 years old, 
    for which he was dismissed from the school. At the same time, Ronaldo has loved football since he was a youngster and wanted to make a profession out of it,
     so he<b> dropped out of school </b>in the middle of his studies.
      Ronaldo's family backed him up in his choice to drop out of school. Cristiano Ronaldo Jr., Ronaldo's son,
       is the youngest of Ronaldo's four children. However, Ronaldo has never revealed the identity of his son's mother.</p>

<br>
<p style="font-size: x-large;">Cristiano Ronaldo's life changed when he made his professional debut for Sporting FC in Portugal. At the age of 16, Cristiano Ronaldo was upgraded to Sporting's first squad by László Bölöni, who was fascinated by his exceptional dribbling abilities and lightning speed. Cristiano Ronaldo's representative reveals that sides such as Barcelona, Liverpool, and Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger expressed willingness to sign the fantastic young Portuguese superstar from Sporting FC in the 2002-2003 season.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: x-large;">2.Manchester United</h3>
<p style="font-size: x-large;">Cristiano Ronaldo became Manchester United's 1st Portuguese player in 2003-2004. He wanted his Sporting FC number 28, but he was given the No.7 jersey at Old Trafford, which David Beckham and Eric Cantona had previously worn. Cristiano Ronaldo made his Manchester United appearance against Bolton Wonders on August 16, 2003, as a replacement for Nicky Butt, and United won the match 4-0. Ronaldo received a standing ovation from the stadium and many compliments from United Legend George Best in his maiden encounter. Cristiano Ronaldo's career took off in the 2006-07 season when he obtained more than 20 goals for Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson, and he established his importance at the match by helping them win their first Premier League championship in four years in the 2005-06 season.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: x-large;">3.Real Madrid</h3>
<p style="font-size: x-large;">Cristiano Ronaldo decided to join Spanish giants Real Madrid from Manchester United for the highest-ever signing fee of £80 million ahead of the 2008-09 season. Madrid announced a 5 year contract with the big star until 2015, paying him £11 million per year and including a €1 billion release fee, marking a big step up in Cristiano Ronaldo's career. Ronaldo was handed the number 9 shirt in his early days at Real Madrid since Raul's club captain wore the number 7. With the sort of success he had at Santiago Bernabeu, Cristiano Ronaldo's life story transformed when he joins Real Madrid from Manchester United. In his eight years at Real Madrid, he has played 292 matches and scored 311 goals.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: x-large;">4.Juventus</h3>
<p style="font-size: x-large;">Ronaldo left Madrid in 2018 for the Italian giants Juventus for a transfer price of €100 million-plus €12 million in additional costs. Ronaldo signed a four-year deal with Juventus, and the fee paid by the new team was the most ever amount paid for any 30-year-old player. Ronaldo scored his first goal for Juventus against Sassuolo in his fourth game for the club, and he was sent off for the first time in his 154th Champions League matches against them.</p>
